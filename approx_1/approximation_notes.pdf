Discussion Points for the Nearest Neighbor Approximation Algorithm

1. Explain Strategy: The Strategy I used is Nearest Neighbor which is a greedy algorithm.
        It is not only greedy due to my incorporation of a random selection for initial vertex.
        This randomness has no restrictions, only that it must be a vertex in the graph.

2. Analytical runtime Analysis: The Nearest Neighbor algorithm runs in O(V^2) which is because
        of how it needs to go through each vertex and each edge of that vertex to find
        the shortest outgoing edge to use that does not lead to a vertex already in visited.
