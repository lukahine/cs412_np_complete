Discussion Points for the Nearest Neighbor Approximation Algorithm

1. Explain Strategy: The Strategy I used is Nearest Neighbor which is a greedy algorithm.
        It is not only greedy due to my incorporation of a random selection for initial vertex.
        This randomness has no restrictions, only that it must be a vertex in the graph.

2. Analytical runtime Analysis: The Nearest Neighbor algorithm runs in O(V^2) which is because
        of how it needs to go through each vertex and each edge of that vertex to find
        the shortest outgoing edge to use that does not lead to a vertex already in visited.



Test Cases and Optimality
Test 1: Always achieves optimal solution given the fact that since each vertex has 2 edges, both edges will always be used,
        Regardless of starting vertex.
Test 2: Will sometimes achieve optimal solution, due to multiple ways to get to the optimal value through different paths
        and starting vertices.
Test 3: Will not achieve optimal solution given that starting from A will go to the smallest edge attached to A, which 
        should not be taken to find optimal path from A.
Test 4: Same explanation as Test 3.
Test 5: Same explanation as Test 3.
